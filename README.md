# Hello-world
Test for introductory tutorial

Hi, my name is Mark. I Have registered here as I am about to embark on developing Android applications, and I have been advised to store them in github.

This is a second edit because I got it all wrong the forst time. this time I need to edit the pull request correctly so that the issue (issue #2) is closed automatically
